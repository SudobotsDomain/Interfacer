# Interfacer
Source files for the Interfacer project. Interfacer is an intelligent UART/USART/VIRTIO scanner which supplements an intermediary interface and a complete device diagnostic from data extracted by serial data via UART extraction including parity and baud rates for common devices allowing the user to bypass difficult consumerist protocols that may prove limiting and interact with the device as desired also giving it additional functionality with the virtual device implementation generated from the USART. The interface is generated based on the format requested by the host control (i.e FAT32, VFAT, EXTFAT, NTFS etc..) The USB contains a refraction copy/write pin that will allow the device to detect any circuits that may have a chip that has retained data.

IR port
___________
The device also has an IR sensor that sends any raw signals to the terminal and decodes them. the IR is connected to the serial/USB Host micro control
