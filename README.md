# Interfacer
Source files for the Interfacer project. Interfacer is an intelligent UART/USART/VIRTIO scanner which supplements an intermediary interface and a complete device diagnostic including parity and baud for common devices allowing the user to bypass difficult consumerist protocols   and interact with the device as desired also giving it additional virtual functionality with the virtual device implementation generated from the USART. The interface is generated based on the format requested by the host (i.e FAT32, VFAT, EXTFAT, NTFS etc..)
